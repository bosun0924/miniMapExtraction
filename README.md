# miniMapExtraction
This program will extract the minimap in the game League of Legends by using image processing technologies.

The minimap could be placed on the right(default) or the left corner to players' personal preferences. Any illegal scale of the minimap for instance, an over 100% scale achieved by editing the JSON file under the config folder, may compromise the accountability.
